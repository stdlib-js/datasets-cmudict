We are excited about your pull request, but unfortunately we are not accepting pull requests against this repository, as all development happens on the [main project repository](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib). We kindly request that you submit this pull request against the [respective directory](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/lib/node_modules/%40stdlib/datasets/cmudict) of the main repository where we’ll review and provide feedback. 

If this is your first stdlib contribution, be sure to read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) which provides guidelines and instructions for submitting contributions. You may also consult the [development guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/docs/contributing/development.md) for help on developing stdlib.

We look forward to receiving your contribution! :smiley:
