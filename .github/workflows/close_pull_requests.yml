          Thank you for submitting a pull request. :raised_hands:
          
          We greatly appreciate your willingness to submit a contribution. However, we are not accepting pull requests against this repository, as all development happens on the [main project repository](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib).
          
          We kindly request that you submit this pull request against the [respective directory](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/tree/develop/lib/node_modules/%40stdlib/datasets/cmudict) of the main repository where weâ€™ll review and provide feedback. If this is your first stdlib contribution, be sure to read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) which provides guidelines and instructions for submitting contributions.
          
          Thank you again, and we look forward to receiving your contribution! :smiley:
          
          Best,
          The stdlib team
